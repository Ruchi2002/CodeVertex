            >(15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist
            and politician who served as the 11th President of India from 2002
            to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and
            studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four
            decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the
            Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) and Indian
            Space Research Organization (ISRO) and was intimately involved in
            India's civilian space program and military missile development
            efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for
            his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
            technology. He also played a pivotal organizational, technical, and
            political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the
            first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</span

            support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the

            "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of education,
            writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient
            of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's
            highest civilian honor</span
